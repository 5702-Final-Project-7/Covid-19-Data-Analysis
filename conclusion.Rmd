# Conclusion

In this report, we analyze the spread and prevention of Covid-19. By observing the global reported cases and deaths by time and space, we explored the overall spreading pattern of the pandemic. As vaccination effectively prevents the spreading of the virus, we also looked at the vaccination rate data. And for more detailed patterns, we focused only on the US vaccination.

We found that the reported cases kept growing ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, but began slowing down in December 2020 with the growth of immunity and the promotion of vaccines. The most significant peak of reported cases appeared in January 2022 with the spread of the Omicron variant. However, the reported deaths did not increase that much in the meantime, from which we could conclude that Omicron spreads more easily than earlier variants, but causes less severe illness and death in general.

By analyzing the global distribution of cases, deaths, and vaccination rates, we found that the bordering countries show similar patterns,  while the countries with strict Covid-19 policies show lower rates compared to surrounding countries, for instance, China. We observed higher death rates in the US compared to European countries with similar or even higher infection rates. We doubt that different methods of counting deaths may have influenced the comparison across regions, leading to more complex questions which may need further information and insights for the explanation.

For the vaccination data, we first observed that the US fully vaccinated rate is 68%, between the median and the third quantile of the global rate. 33.7% of the US population has taken the booster, but there are still 20.3% of the population who have not taken any vaccine. We also noticed that the vaccination rate grows with age. Specifically, people aged over 65 have the highest fully vaccinated rate of 88.6% and a vaccinated rate of 95%.
