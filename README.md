This repository is the final project of EDAV 2022 Fall course.

In this project,we aim to explore the worldwide spread trend of the disease as well as detailed patterns in the US. The questions we are most curious about include: What is the overall features of the incidence across the world from 2019 to 2022,including spatial distribution and time series characteristics? How much does vaccination prevent the spread? We use exploratory data analysis methods to investigate those questions.
