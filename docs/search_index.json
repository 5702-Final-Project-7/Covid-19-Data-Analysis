The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. It’s important for data scientists to analyze the patterns of the Covid-19 data,to control and manage the COVID-19 epidemic, and to effectively prevent and respond to future epidemics. In this project,we aim to explore the worldwide spread trend of the disease as well as detailed patterns in the US. The questions we are most curious about include: What is the overall features of the incidence across the world from 2019 to 2022,including spatial distribution and time series characteristics? How much does vaccination prevent the spread? We use exploratory data analysis methods to investigate those questions. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic The research focuses on the data of COVID-19. We aim to explore the worldwide spread trend of the disease as well as detailed patterns in specific countries. The questions we are most curious about include: What is the overall trend of the incidence across the world from 2019 to 2022? How much does vaccination prevent the spread? How does special public health and social measures influence the incidence and are there any side-effects? The context of the research is organised as the following. In the first part of the analysis, we explore the global COVID-19 cases and deaths, with time ranging from 2019 to 2022. We hope to present the overall pattern of the spread in different time and spaces. The second part of the research features the the introduction and influence of the vaccination. We analyze only vaccination data in the US to reveal more detailed information. In the last part of the research, we look at the effects of special public health measures in preventing the epidemic, as well as their potential influence in the society. This part uses data from China, where strict policies, like restriction on gatherings or adapting and closing offices have taken place. 2.2 Data availability We will use data from the WHO coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard, U.S. COVID-19 Data from CDC and JHU, and data dashboard website of National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2.2.1 The WHO coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard The dashboard data present official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccine utilisation reported by countries, territories and areas.Links:https://covid19.who.int/data 2.2.1.1 Data source Case and death count data: WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications, complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts. Since 22 March 2020, global data are compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported to WHO headquarters daily. Vaccine data: these data are pooled from numerous sources, including direct reports from Member States, WHO review of publicly available official data, or data collated and published by third-party sites. 2.2.1.2 Data format Data can be downloaded in comma-separated values (CSV) files. They can be imported by R read.csv() function. 2.2.1.3 Frequency of updates Cases and deaths are updated on a daily basis except weekends. Vaccine data are updated on a weekly basis. WHO continues to encourage all users to prioritize weekly counts and long-term trends (over several weeks) as a more reliable measure of COVID-19 epidemiological activity. 2.2.2 United States COVID-19 Data - CDC &amp; JHU 2.2.2.1 Description The cases and deaths data provides cases and deaths dating back to the beginning of the pandemic in January 2020. Link: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series The vaccination data provides the vaccination efforts across the United States. Link: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-pop5 2.2.2.2 Data source Cases and deaths data: the data is sourced from governments, national and subnational agencies across the country - a full list of data sources is published on Johns Hopkins’s GitHub site. COVID-19 data were collected by states and consolidated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Vaccination data: the data is sourced from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Federal agency data are included as part of jurisdiction, state, or territory aggregate metrics. To avoid duplicate counts, the agency data will not be combined with other data. National and jurisdictional metrics reported to CDC include vaccination data distribution to and administered in the jurisdiction partner clinics, retail pharmacies, and federal partners and programs. 2.2.2.3 Data format The data can be downloaded as csv file. We will combine the data files in R for data analysis. 2.2.2.4 Frequency of updates COVID-19 cases and deaths data are updated once per day between 04:45 and 05:15 GMT, with the most recent official numbers up to the previous day. Vaccination data are updated once a week, with data up to the previous day. Data from previous days will be updated as vaccination records are processed. 2.2.2.5 Delays in death reports The number of deaths reported on a given day does not necessarily reflect the actual number of COVID-19 deaths on that day, or in the previous 24 hours. This is due to lags and delays in reporting. The delay in reporting can be on the order of days and sometimes as long as a week or more. This means the number of deaths reported on a given day is not reflective of the actual number of deaths that occurred on that day. 2.2.3 National Bureau of Statistics of China We can find the total mortality rate of China at a yearly basis on the national data website of National Bureau of Statistics of China.Links:https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01 2.2.3.1 Data source National Bureau of Statistics of China collects and calculates the data based on sample survey. 2.2.3.2 Data format The data can be downloaded in CSV files. They can be imported by R read.csv() function. 2.2.3.3 Frequency of updates The total mortality rates are updated on an annual basis. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources We collect data from WHO for COVID-19 Dashboard and CDC &amp; JHU data for United States COVID-19 analysis. We download the csv files from the websites. 3.1.1 WHO COVID-19 Dashboard There is a csv file for the cumulative cases and deaths data of each country. The country names, iso number, date reported are also included in the csv file. There are 239 records of countries and regions, including Global category and others category. There is a csv file for global vaccination data. We can load the number of persons vaccinated with different numbers of vaccines and vaccination rates of different countries from the file. The country names, WHO region, iso number, date reported are also included in the csv file. There are 229 records of countries and regions. 3.1.2 CDC &amp; JHU Data for United States COVID-19 Analysis The vaccination data provides the vaccination efforts across the United States and is downloaded as csv file. It provides the doses attributed, doses administered and vaccination rate with different age groups by state. There are 54 records of jurisdiction (State/Territory). The global confirmed cases data provides the daily confirmed cases, reported at the country/region level. The province/state, country/region, date are included the csv file. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 COVID-19 Cases and Deaths 3.2.1.1 Distribution by Space The cumulative cases and deaths data from WHO can be loaded from the csv files directly. Then we select infection rates, fatality rates, country names and country iso numbers from the data frame. For the vaccine data, we load the csv file and select country names, country numbers and persons with 1+ doses of 100 population from the data frame. Then we store the data frames in Rdata files for future use. 3.2.2 Distribution by Time To analyze the global spread of COVID-19, it’s helpful to observe the reported cases and deaths as a three-year time series from early 2020 to late 2020. The data is collected from the report of different countries separately, so we first sum them up to obtain the global reported data by day. We notice that there is a delay in data collection on weekends in the data set, which may lead to an undesired cyclic pattern. To deal with that, we also build another data frame by grouping the reported date by week. We believe this weekly reported data frame may bring clearer insights of the data. We also extract the U.S. data from the global data set, and compute the reported cases and deaths by day and week. It will provide a deeper insight in our following analysis. 3.2.3 U.S. Vaccination Data 3.2.3.1 U.S. Vaccination Compared to the Global Data To analyze the U.S. vaccination rate, we tried to compare it to those of other countries in the world. We used the WHO global vaccination data, which provides detailed vaccination data divided by countries. For each country, it gives the total vaccinations, the vaccinated rate, fully vaccinated rate as well as the main type of vaccines the country uses. In our analysis, we only care about the vaccinated rate and fully vaccinated rate of different countries. Another issue of the data is missing values and outliers. There’s no fully vaccinated rate for Guernsey, and the fully vaccinated rate of Eritrea, Brunei Darussalam, Gibraltar, Palau and Tokelau are more than 100%. So we drop these six rows. 3.2.3.2 Vaccination State in U.S. Populations We further made use of the global vaccination data set by extracting the U.S. data, and calculating the proportion of vaccination, full vaccination, boosting in the U.S. population. The data frame consists of 5 columns: ‘country’, ‘not_vaccinated’, ‘vaccinated’, ‘fully_vaccinated’, and ‘boosted’. We transformed it to tidy form which only contains 3 columns for further graphing. 3.2.3.3 U.S. Vaccination by Age For the vaccination rate of different age groups, we use the data from CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention). It provides vaccinated and fully vaccinated rate by age. As each age group yields several observations from different date, we use the data from the latest update as the vaccinated rate is a cumulative variable. Besides, there are no reported data from children less than 5 years old, as they are too young to get vaccinated, so we only focus on 6 age groups: ‘5 - 1’,‘12 - 17’,‘18 - 24’,‘25 - 49’, ‘50 - 64’, and ‘65+’. 3.2.3.4 U.S. Vaccination by State To analyze the vaccination progress across the United States, we used CDC united states vaccination data. It provides the detailed vaccination rate by each jurisdiction. For each jurisdiction, it specifies the percent of residents vaccinated, doses administered, doses distributed, and fully vaccination rate. We compared the percent of people fully vaccinated and US average fully vaccination rate in the next chapter. 3.2.3.5 Vaccination and Reported Cases To analyze the vaccination effort in the United States, we used JHU COVID-19 cases and CDC vaccination data. The COVID-19 cases data provides the reported cases from Jan 2020 to now. The data is collected from the report of different countries separately. We calculated the daily new cases and weekly new cases to gain insights from it. The global vaccination data provides the reported doses from Dec 2020 to now for each country. We also calculated the daily new doses and weekly new doses for the vaccination effort in United States. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 WHO COVID-19 dashboard There are no NAN values in the cumulative cases and deaths data. But there are 4 countries/regions with 0 cases and deaths.They are Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Saint Helena, Tokelau and Turkmenistan. It implies that they didn’t report to the WHO and their data are missing. There is a category “other” in the table and it may contain data of countries not included in the 237 countries/ regions. There are 8 countries/regions which have cumulative cases and deaths data but don’t have vaccination data. By comparing the two table we can find the countries are Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Holy See, Mayotte, Réunion, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon. They are relatively small regions which may lack relevant data. 3.3.2 WHO Vaccination Data There are some missing values in the WHO global vaccination data set. More than 87% of the observations are complete cases, while about 10% of the observations have missing values on PERSONS_BOOSTER_ADD_DOSE (bp) and PERSONS_BOOSTER_ADD_DOSE_PER100 (brat), probably because some countries have not promoted boosters. Very few rows have missing values on other variables such as VACCINES_USED (type). But fortunately, as we mainly focus on fully vaccinated rate in the global data, we have almost complete data in all the countries. We also notice that the US data is complete in this data set, which can be used for further analysis. 3.3.3 CDC Global Vaccine Data As we can see from the chart, the missing values consist of 3.4% of the dataset. It is an univariate missing pattern where missing data occur only in doses_n. There are about 70% missing data around January 2021. Missing data gradually decrease over time and remain very low starting from June 2021. The main reason could many countries lack access to vaccines at the beginning of the approval of COVID-19 vaccines due to the delays and shortages. Many countries have sufficient vaccines over time, the missing data decrease as well.

The map is interactive. Put the mouse over a particular area, and the detailed data will appear. The maps can be zoomed in by clicking the buttons on the left and be dragged by holding the left button of the mouse. The data is updated on 2022/12/05. We can see from the graphs that European countries show high infection rates, followed by the Americas. The reported infection rate in Asia and Africa is relatively late. The bordering countries show similar infection rates, while the countries with strict covid-19 policies show lower rates compared to surrounding countries, for instance, China. It has been noted on the WHO website that the case and death data for the Region of Africa are incomplete. Therefore the actual infection rates in Africa may be higher than reported. Countries with high infection rates are more likely to report more deaths. For the vaccination data, we can see that countries in Europe and in the Americas tend to show higher vaccination rates, which are the richer countries with more medical resources. We find from the data that the death rates are relatively high in the US compared to countries with similar or even higher infection rates in Europe. For example, the infection rate in the US is 29491/100000, and the death rate is 324/100000, while the figures for France are 566638/100000 and 238/100000. We first infer that it may be caused by the difference in calculating death cases. In the US, if COVID-19 appears among the causes and contributors, CDC guidance counts that as a COVID-19-related death. Some countries in Europe record solely deaths of those who have been tested and that occurred in the hospital. But for countries like France and German, their case numbers include those who died “of” COVID-19 and those who died “with” the disease, both in hospitals and care houses. The United Kingdom has been reporting all deaths after a positive test within 60 days as a coronavirus death. So the different counting methods in Europe may not be the main cause of the lower rates of deaths here. The reasons behind these differences may be complicated. From the data we have now, the US shows similar vaccination rates, and the differences may be caused by medical resources, various types of social distance measures, and time affected by Covid-19. 4.2 Time series analysis for Covid-19 cases and deaths worldwide Covid-19 started at the beginning of 2020, and spread quickly accross the world. To analyze the overall spread pattern of the pademic, we analyze the global cases and deaths data as a time series. By plotting the time series by day, we observed a strong cyclic pattern, making the data very noisy. This is because of the delay of data update during weekends of the original dataset. To remove the cyclic pattern, it’s better to use the weekly time series. From the two weekly time series, we observed the following patterns. The first spike of reported deaths appeared in April 2020, with no spike in reported cases at the same time. This refer to the early spread in China. The low cases and high deaths also indicate the high fatality rate of the virus at the beginning. In January 2021, both the reported cases and reported deaths experience a relatively strong spike. During this time, the has pandemic spreaded worldwide, and contries in Europe and America are experiencing a high infection rate of Covid-19. The reported cases and deaths began decreasing slowly with vaccination being available since December 2020. The most outstanding spike of reported cases appeared in January 2022, with over 20 million weekly new cases around the world. This was over four times of that in January 2021. This was exactly the time when Omicron variant spread drastically accross the world. However, the report deaths did not increase that much at the mean time, from which we could conclude that Omicron spreads more easily than earlier variants, but causes less severe illness and death in general. 4.3 Time series analysis for Covid-19 cases &amp; deaths in the U.S. The United States is the country with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach. The introduction and widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines has led to changing patterns of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality over the course of the pandemic. The weekly time series is a better way to view trends in new cases and deaths. It also can serve as a warning: if cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. As we can see from the chart, we observed the following patterns: A rise in deaths usually follows a rise in new cases by about a month. For example, after the delta variant caused a surge of new cases beginning in July 2021, the death toll began to climb in August. COVID-19–related deaths substantially decreased in the United States in March 2022. During April - early November 2022, this initial decline was largely sustained and the overall number of COVID-19 related deaths remained relatively stable. During January 2022, new cases sharply rose again amidst the spread of the Omicron variant, resulting in the highest case rates recorded since the start of the pandemic. By February 2022, new cases had fallen sharply, and disparities once again narrowed. 4.4 Understanding overall vaccination data in the U.S. In this section, we focus on the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination data. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we try to answer the following questions - what is the overall level of US vaccination comparing to global data? How many Americans have been fully vaccinated while how many of them haven’t taken any vaccination? Which state has the highest vaccination rate? We first draw a boxplot of the fully vaccinated rate of different countries across the world. The median of global fully vaccinated rate is 61.165, while the US fully vaccinated rate is 67.989, which is between the median and third quantile of the global data. To understand the different vaccination state of the US population, we produced a stacked bar chart. We observed that 68% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, among which 33.7% of the population has taken the booster. However, there are still 20.3% of the population who have not taken any vaccine. A deeper insight of the vaccination in the US would be dividing the total population by age groups. From the grouped bar chart below, both the vaccinated and fully vaccinated rate grow with the age groups. People aged over 65 have the highest fully vaccinated rate of 88.6% and vaccinated rate of 95%. This is reasonable because the old people are more prone to be infected by the virus, so they are more likely to take the complete series of vaccines. Children less than 12 years are too young so their parents may worry about the side effects of the vaccine, so they have a lowest fully vaccinated rate of 16.7% and a vaccinated rate of 25.6%. 4.5 Exploring vaccination progress by U.S. state To explore U.S. vaccination efforts, we draw the boxplot of the fully vaccinated rate by state. The median of U.S. fully vaccinated rate is 66.3%, while the U.S. average fully vaccinated rate is 68.9%. To compare states’ vaccination progress, we produced the Cleveland dot plot below. We can see that these are the states, territories with the highest fully vaccination rates: Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, Vermont, D.C., and Massachusetts. Over half of the states’ fully vaccination rates are below U.S. average rate. 4.6 How effective are vaccines at reducing the infection rate? The blue dash-dotted line is the cumulative daily cases over time (right y-axis). The red dash-dotted line is the cumulative vaccination coverage of fully vaccinated individuals in the population (right y-axis). The chart shows a timeline of COVID-19 developments during the pandemic, including important events and vaccination timeline. We can see that the new infections slow down after the vaccine rollout in December 2020. During January 2022, the Omicron variants have been particularly immune-evasive and drove the largest surge in COVID-19 cases to date. COVID-19 monovalent vaccines available at the time were not as efficacious against the variant as bivalent boosters introduced later, but the wave would have been more devastating in the absence of vaccination. A limitation of our study is that we modeled only viral dynamics within the U.S. However, vaccines developed by the U.S. were also deployed around the world, changing the trajectory of the pandemic on a global scale. Without them, more variants could have emerged or there could have been greater importation of COVID-19 cases. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component Here we present an interactive version of the global weekly new reported cases from 2020.01 to 2022.11.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In this report, we analyze the spread and prevention of COVID-19. By observing the global reported cases and deaths by time and space, we explored the overall spreading pattern of the pandemic. As vaccination effectively prevents the spreading of the virus, we also looked at the vaccination rate data. And for more detailed patterns, we focused only on the US vaccination. We found that the reported cases kept growing ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, but began slowing down in December 2020 with the growth of immunity and the promotion of vaccines. The most significant peak of reported cases appeared in January 2022 with the spread of the Omicron variant. However, the reported deaths did not increase that much in the meantime, from which we could conclude that Omicron spreads more easily than earlier variants, but causes less severe illness and death in general. By analyzing the global distribution of cases, deaths, and vaccination rates, we found that the bordering countries show similar patterns, while the countries with strict COVID-19 policies show lower rates compared to surrounding countries, for instance, China. We observed higher death rates in the US compared to European countries with similar or even higher infection rates. We doubt that different methods of counting deaths may have influenced the comparison across regions, leading to more complex questions which may need further information and insights for the explanation. For the vaccination data, we first observed that the US fully vaccinated rate is 68%, between the median and the third quantile of the global rate 33.7% of the US population has taken the booster, but there are still 20.3% of the population who have not taken any vaccine. We also noticed that the vaccination rate grows with age. Specifically, people aged over 65 have the highest fully vaccinated rate of 88.6% and a vaccinated rate of 95%. By comparing the outcomes across the United States before and after the initiation of vaccination programs, we evaluated the impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-related deaths declined steeply during February - April 2022 and remained through August 2022 compared to rates observed during June 2021 – February 2022. As vaccination rates increase in the United States, vaccines continued to be effective in reducing COVID-19–related mortality. It has been two years since the first COVID-19 vaccine was given to a patient in the United States. The US average fully vaccinated rate is 68.9% now, and the impact of the vaccination program is more remarkable given the challenges posed by the multiple variants that have arisen. The Delta variant has substantially postponed the predicted herd immunity date, through a combination of reduced vaccine effectiveness, and increased infection and death rates. The Omicron variants have been particularly immune-evasive and caused the largest wave of infections during the pandemic. However, vaccination has significantly slowed the growth of total COVID-19 cases and provides broader protection against death.
